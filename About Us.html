		<p><span class="textfont">We are a group of five hoping to make World Of Proability easier for those who are interested. You will see throughout the website how we have linked back the topics to where they are used in the industry. We believe that students should understand topics that they are taught at school and for that to happen, they need to undertsand how this is used in the real world.</span></p>
		<p><span class="textfont"><em>&quot;Those that know, do. Those that understand teach.&quot; -  Aristotle</em></span></p>
		<p><span class="textfont"> This wesbite was based around this quote. We want students to understand the topics that we are teaching through this website in hopes of them teaching others someday. </span></p>

  <p><span class="subheading"> <u><strong>Who is this website for?</strong></u></span></p>
  <p><span class="textfont">This website was designed to teach a level students and people who have a general interest for statistics. For students who have no previous background knowledge of the topics we have incorporated key definitions so that it will become easier for them to understand. To further enhance the learning experience, we have added a quiz at the end of each section. This will ensure students are able to revise areas that they found difficult.</span></p>
