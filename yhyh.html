	<p><span class="subheading"> What is random sampling?</span></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span class="textfont">Random samples are used to avoid bias and other unwanted effects. Of course, it isn’t quite as simple as it seems: choosing a random sample isn’t as simple as just picking 100 people from 10,000 people. You have to be sure that your random sample is truly random!A simple random sample is often mentioned in elementary statistics classes, but it’s actually one of the least used techniques.In theory, it’s easy to understand. However, in practice it’s tough to perform.</span></p>

	 <p><span class="subheading"> How to generate a random sample</span></p>
  <p><span class="textfont">Generating a random sample is easy compared to the rest of the sampling methods Imagine that a researcher wants to understand more about the career goals of students at a single university. Let's say that the university has roughly 10,000 students. These 10,000 students are our population (N). Each of the 10,000 students is known as a unit (although sometimes other terms are used to describe a unit; see Sampling: The basics). In order to select a sample (n) of students from this population of 10,000 students, we could choose to use a simple random sample.</span></p>

	<p><span class="textfont"> This video shows how we can generate a random sample. After watching this video we can see that it is easy to create one in comaprison to the other sampling methods. But where do we actually use this? Well its used in pretty much everything as data science allows us to front in all directions.</span></p>
